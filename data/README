All data downloaded from the original sources should be stored here.
Ideally, these data should not have been modified in any way, or only
minimally modified. Large data files should not be commited to the git
repository. If small data files are committed, make sure that data
usage conditions are being correctly followed (e.g., sometimes data
files cannot be made publicly available).
